	I do not make any money or profit from the music I make and upload here (and on other platforms) so the purpose of all of
	this is only entertainment.<br><br><br>I do not take requests about what music I should make, so I upload them whether
	the listener enjoys it or not.<br><br><br>The "covers" of my music do come from copyrighted material but they are
	re-mixed by me and are free to download and listen to. I also credit the original composers.<br><br><br>
	You're allowed to use my music in your projects or videos and you don't have to ask, but I should recommend you to credit
	my name and DO NOT leave my music uncredited or claiming them as your own.</b> </td>
